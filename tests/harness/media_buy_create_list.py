"""MediaBuyCreateListEnv — composite env for the post-create get_media_buys poll.

The UC-019 storyboard scenario polls get_media_buys for a buy the SAME scenario
just created, so it needs both tools in one environment and one identity. That is
what the graded storyboard step does too: AdCP 3.1.1
``dist/compliance/3.1.1/domains/media-buy/scenarios/available_actions.yaml`` →
phase ``read_persisted_buy_actions`` → step ``get_created_buy_available_actions``
sends ``media_buy_ids: ["$context.<id captured from create_media_buy>"]`` and
validates the response against ``media-buy/get-media-buys-response.json``.

Shape mirrors ``MediaBuyDualEnv`` (create + update): extend ``MediaBuyCreateEnv``
and route by request type. The get_media_buys dispatch itself is inherited from
``MediaBuyListDispatchMixin`` rather than re-implemented, so this env and
``MediaBuyListEnv`` grade the same tool through the same code.

REST is intentionally NOT routed: UC-019 is a ``_NO_REST_UC`` (get_media_buys has
no REST route, tests/bdd/conftest.py:2885-2895), so the create and list REST
bodies never both apply in one scenario and wiring an ungraded second REST path
would be speculative. The inherited create REST dispatch is left untouched.

        ``get_media_buys`` has no REST route — ``src/routes/api_v1.py`` routes
        create, update and delivery for media buys, nothing for the list. Without this
        the inherited create builder handles the call: it is create-shaped, so it dies
        inside ``_restore_creative_ids`` reading a ``packages`` attribute the list
        request does not have, and the test grades a different call than it names.

        Scope, precisely: this refuses the ``req=GetMediaBuysRequest(...)`` arm, keyed
        on the same ``_is_list_request`` discriminator ``call_impl``/``call_a2a``/
        ``call_mcp`` use. A flat-kwargs call still routes to create here exactly as it
        does on every other transport of this env — consistent, not a REST-specific
        mis-dispatch, and deliberately left alone.

        The refusal is declared HERE, per env, and deliberately not derived from the
        route table. The two staleness failures are not symmetric: a route DELETED
        while deriving means the REST arm silently stops being graded and the suite
        stays green, whereas a route ADDED while declaring means the first REST call
        fails at this line — which is the line that must change anyway, since the list
        mixin's body builder is flat-kwargs-only and could not dispatch correctly on
        its own.

        ``pytest.fail`` and not ``NotImplementedError`` or ``AssertionError``, because
        this refusal has to survive two launderers to be loud at all:
        ``tests/bdd/conftest.py`` converts a ``NotImplementedError`` raised in a call
        phase into a skip + xfail — the silent matrix-shrink this exists to prevent —
        and ``RestDispatcher.dispatch`` wraps the whole dispatch, this builder
        included, in ``except Exception`` and returns the refusal as an error-shaped
        result indistinguishable from a production error response. ``Failed`` derives
        from ``BaseException`` and is not a ``NotImplementedError``, so neither can
        eat it. Do not "simplify" the dialect.
