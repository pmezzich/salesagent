"""Importing the audit logger must not touch the filesystem.

``src.core.audit_logger`` used to create a CWD-relative ``logs/`` directory and
open two ``logging.FileHandler``s at MODULE IMPORT time. Import-time I/O on a
relative path makes the module's importability depend on who owns the current
working directory, which is a property no importer can control:

* under Docker every suite runs with CWD ``/app`` on a bind mount shared with
  the server container. Whichever container touched ``logs/audit.log`` first
  owned it at mode 644, and the other uid then died at *collection* with
  ``PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/logs/audit.log'`` --
  taking every suite that imports this module with it;
* anyone running the suite from a directory they cannot write hits the same
  wall, with no way to opt out short of not importing the module.

The invariant these tests pin is therefore about the import itself, not about
any particular deployment: importing a logging module writes nothing, so it
cannot fail on a filesystem it was never asked to touch. Handlers open on first
emit instead, which is when a log path is genuinely needed.
