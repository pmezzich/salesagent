"""Guard: one Gherkin sentence must have exactly one meaning.

Two checks, both behavioral (they read the real ``pytestbdd_stepdef_*`` fixtures
pytest-bdd built at import time, not source text), over every module listed in
``tests/bdd/conftest.py``'s ``pytest_plugins``.

Check 1 — NAME IDENTITY (``test_no_shadowed_step_registrations``)
    pytest-bdd turns each ``@given/@when/@then`` into a module-level fixture named
    ``pytestbdd_stepdef_<type>_<parsed text>``. When two registered modules declare
    the same step text, the two fixtures collide by name; pytest resolves the
    collision by plugin registration order, so ONE definition wins and the other —
    which usually carries *different* verification logic — is silently dead.

Check 2 — MATCH OVERLAP (``test_no_domain_exact_text_shadows_generic_parser``)
    Name identity is blind to the more common shape of the same disease: a domain
    module registers an EXACT-TEXT step whose sentence a ``generic`` module's
    *parser* also matches. The two fixtures have different names, so check 1 sees
    nothing, yet exactly one of the two bodies grades the scenario and the loser is
    dead code. This check runs every step line in ``tests/bdd/features/`` through
    every registered parser (filtered by step type first, exactly as production does
    at ``pytest_bdd/scenario.py``) and fails when a line is matched by BOTH a
    non-generic module's exact-text step AND a ``tests.bdd.steps.generic.*`` parser.

Why check 2 is scoped to *that* shape and not "2+ modules match one line":
measured at HEAD over all feature step lines x all registered parsers, the broad
rule fires on 11 cross-module collision classes. Three of them are a domain module
deliberately narrowing a generic sentence, and they resolve only by conftest
``pytest_plugins`` ORDER — reordering that list silently changes grading. Landing
the broad rule would therefore force ~10 behavioural winner-decisions in
UC-002/003/004/006 grading. The narrowed rule names one disease and needs NO
allowlist.

Deliberately OUT OF SCOPE here, to be raised in follow-up work rather than parked
in an allowlist (an allowlist would re-admit the disease):
  * generic-vs-domain match overlap in general — 5 classes at HEAD, of which this
    check grades only the exact-text subset;
  * cross-module match overlap in general — 11 classes at HEAD, including the three
    order-dependent deliberate-narrowing classes described above;
  * INTRA-module ambiguity — 34 further step texts across 7 modules where two
    parsers in the SAME module match one sentence. No "2+ modules" rule can see
    these.
  * module-LOCAL steps in scenario-binding test files (``tests/bdd/test_uc*.py``).
    A scenario-binding module cannot be imported outside a pytest session
    (``pytest_bdd.scenario.get_from_ini`` reads ``CONFIG_STACK[-1]``), so a plain
    unit-test guard can only cover ``pytest_plugins`` modules; covering test modules
    needs a collection-time hook.

All three limits are tracked on GH #1938, which owns the duplicate-step class and
carries the measurement behind them (11 cross-module collision classes, 34 further
intra-module texts, and the fact that for the deliberate-narrowing classes the winner
is decided purely by ``pytest_plugins`` registration ORDER). They are declared here
rather than allowlisted because an allowlist would re-admit the disease this guard
exists to remove.

Neither check has an allowlist, by design.

GH #1941 — the name-identity check, and the match-overlap check added below.

(The provenance line here used to carry a beads id. Beads ids do not resolve for
anyone outside this workspace, which is the repo's own rule for FIXME references;
the GitHub number is the citable form.)
