"""Guard: the persisted status vocabulary is coerced in exactly one place.

``media_buys.status`` is a closed vocabulary (``PersistedMediaBuyStatus``) stored in
a ``String`` column, so SOMETHING must turn a column string into a member. That
coercion is ``PersistedMediaBuyStatus.parse`` / ``parse_or_none`` and nothing else.

Why a guard rather than a convention: before this rule there were three coercions
with three different failure policies — one returned ``False``, one raised a located
``ValueError``, one raised a bare ``ValueError`` from inside a per-row loop, so a
single unmapped row failed an entire tenant listing and reached the buyer as
``VALIDATION_ERROR``/correctable for a defect in the SELLER's own store. Each was
locally reasonable. The damage came from there being three.

Two spellings are refused:

1. ``PersistedMediaBuyStatus(x)`` — direct construction. It raises ``ValueError``,
   which no boundary translates into a spec envelope, and it skips the case
   normalization every other reader assumes.
2. ``(x or "").lower()`` on a status — the hand-rolled normalize-then-compare that
   each of the three sites had grown its own copy of.

# That is deliberate — an exemption for the defining module is exactly where a fourth
# coercion would reappear, and the pre-fix ``is_media_buy_seller_confirmed`` lived
