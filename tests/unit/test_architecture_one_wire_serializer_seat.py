"""Guard: wire shaping happens in the one serializer seat, not per class.

Two rules, one root. ``WireSerializerMixin`` (src/core/schemas/_base.py) owns the
single ``@model_serializer(mode="wrap")`` through which a response model shapes what
reaches the buyer. Both violations below are ways of stepping outside that seat, and
both fail SILENTLY — which is what makes them worth a guard rather than a review note.

1. **Hand-rolled required-nullable re-insert.** ``model_dump()`` calls ``super()``
   and then puts a key back that ``exclude_none=True`` dropped. It is invisible to
   ``model_dump_json()``, it cannot see the caller's ``exclude=``, and under
   ``mode="json"`` it can plant a raw Python value in a JSON document. Name the
   schema in ``_PINNED_SCHEMA_REF`` instead — the retained set is derived from the
   pin's required-and-nullable intersection, so it cannot drift from the spec.

2. **A second model serializer on one model.** Pydantic runs only the FIRST model
   serializer it finds in the MRO and drops the rest with no error and no warning, so
   a class that declares its own beside an inherited one silently disables the
   inherited behaviour. Verified on the pinned pydantic: two wrap serializers on one
   model produce exactly one call. Extend the shared seat instead.

Introduced with the L5 reshape (GH #1900 remediation): the scan behind that change
found the pattern at two sites, one of which was the abstraction itself.
