"""Guard: MediaBuyRepository is the only writer of ``revision`` and ``confirmed_at``.

Both fields are repository-managed by construction. ``revision`` is the buyer's
optimistic-concurrency token, so it must be bumped by exactly one code path that
cannot be forgotten; ``confirmed_at`` is the seller-commitment instant and is
write-once. Any assignment to either field outside
``src/core/database/repositories/`` re-opens the hole that PR #1941's review
found: a by-construction contract re-implemented as a compensating call that a
future writer forgets to make.

**This guard is a forward-lock, not a first-run red.** It is GREEN at the commit
that introduces it — measured: the only assignments to these two attributes
anywhere in ``src/`` are the two inside
``src/core/database/repositories/media_buy.py``. Its grade is therefore the
MUTATION, not the first run: move either of those writes (or any new stamp/bump
the lane adds) outside ``repositories/`` and this test must go red. The
``test_detector_*`` cases below are the standing non-vacuity proof that the
detector can actually see such a write.

Deliberately NOT guarded: ``.status``. Too many unrelated entities own a status
column, so a ``.status`` scan would be noise rather than a seam.

Precedent: ``tests/unit/test_architecture_no_raw_media_package_select.py``.

    alias-proof without resolving anything: ``update(MediaBuy)``, ``update(MB)`` and
    ``update(models.MediaBuy)`` all reach the same matcher, because the keyword is the
    part that cannot be renamed. Measured against the tree: 55 ``.values(...)`` calls in
