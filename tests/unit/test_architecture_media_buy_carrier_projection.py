"""Guard: the get_media_buys carrier cannot re-derive the facts it was handed.

``_MediaBuyData`` exists so the build loop projects rather than decides. That claim is
only true while the carrier withholds the INPUTS a status is derived from — it is not
made true by deleting the second ``_compute_status`` call, because a deleted call can be
written again, and it is not made true by renaming the field, because a rename leaves
``resolve_canonical_status(carrier, today)`` working exactly as before.

So the criterion is graded as *the inputs are absent*, not as *the call is gone*. That
distinction is the whole finding this guard records: a structural claim a rename can
satisfy is a claim about the name, not the shape.

There is no buyer-visible surface for any of this — the carrier is module-private — so no
BDD row can reach it. Left ungraded, "the fields were deleted" would be a declaration
nothing measures, which is indistinguishable from a deletion that never happened.

    The hole this closes that the field check above cannot: an input re-exposed through a
    DESCRIPTOR rather than a dataclass field. A ``@property`` named ``status`` does not
    appear in ``__dataclass_fields__``, so the roster check passes while
    ``resolve_canonical_status`` works again — measured, not supposed.

    It does NOT catch a rename. ``resolve_canonical_status`` reads ``buy.status`` first
    (_media_buy_status.py:179-183), so this assertion is really "the carrier has no
    attribute named ``status``" — a name check wearing a behaviour check's clothes.
    Restoring the same data under new field names (``flight_start``,
    ``persisted_lifecycle``) passes all three tests here. That blind spot is SHARED by
    the whole guard, and it is stated rather than papered over: an earlier version of
