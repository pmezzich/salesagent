"""Integration test for migration 7f3a1c9e2b04 — backfill media_buys.confirmed_at.

`2c4e6a7b8d9e` added `confirmed_at` nullable and left historical rows NULL. The
pinned get-media-buys-response schema forbids a seller-confirmed item from
carrying a null `confirmed_at`, so those rows are a DATA defect, and the ruling
(plan §6 ALTERATIONS A1) is that data defects are corrected by migration — never
by a read-time compatibility branch.

This grades the correction itself:

  * a seller-confirmed row with a NULL stamp and an approval instant takes
    `approved_at` (the manual-approval path),
  * one with no approval instant falls back to `created_at` (the synchronous
    auto-approve path),
  * a row in an UNCONFIRMED status keeps NULL — it has no commitment instant, so
    NULL is its correct value and not missing data, even when it happens to have
    an `approved_at` the naive UPDATE would have copied,
  * a row that already carries a stamp is untouched (write-once holds),
  * ZERO rows remain in the defective state afterwards — asserted directly,
    because the bar is zero and not "the rows I happened to name",
  * downgrade re-NULLs only what the backfill would have written, leaving a
    genuinely-observed stamp alone.

Every case is gated on non-vacuity: the seeded rows are asserted to be IN the
defective state before the migration runs, otherwise each post-condition is
trivially true.

Setup is raw SQL rather than factories, following the precedent of the other
migration tests in this directory (`test_timestamptz_migration.py`,
`test_composite_pk_orphan_migration.py`, `test_delivery_measurement_migration.py`):
a migration test legitimately operates below the ORM, and the ORM model describes
the schema at HEAD rather than at the revision under test.
